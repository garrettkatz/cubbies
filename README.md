This repository contains the formal proofs and code and for the paper "Towards Automated Discovery of God-like Folk Algorithms for Rubik's Cube".

The formal proofs for the paper are in the file ``proofs.pdf.''

The experimental result data in the paper can be regenerated by running the following scripts:

- `rcons_experiments.py` for the RCONS experiments.  Set `do_cons` and `confirm` in the `__main__` block to `True`, and adjust other hyperparameters as desired
- `monte_carlo_backtracking.py` for the multi-objective optimization experiments.  Set `do_cons` in the `__main__` block to `True`, and adjust other hyperparameters as desired

The figures can be generated by running the following scripts:

- `example_alg.py` for the illustration of the algorithm
- `rcons_experiments.py` after regenerating the experimental data, by setting `showresults` in the `__main__` block to `True`.
- `all_mcb_results.py` after running `monte_carlo_backtracking.py` on both the 5040 and 29k cube variants

The figures are saved as pdf files in the repository directory.
