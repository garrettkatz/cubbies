rewindable prefix macro database?
profile full ftb again with prefix db
new ftw:
    try multiple trails from each fork-point, including trail root
    move fork-points forward rather than from trail end?
    coordinate with full frontier to save any trail that is non-dominated, regardless of current scalarization
go from facie to oriented cubie representation
replace actions with action indexes in cube domain
replace actions with action indexes and/or resulting permutations in macro database

DONE speed test for macro database vs brute query (two orders of magnitude faster at 1000 rules)
DONE "system" test for macro database add rule: must match brute query result
